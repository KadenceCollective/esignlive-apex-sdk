# Apex SDK for eSignLive
This SDK allows you to integrate with eSignLive's REST API using Apex.  Examples on how to use the SDK are included in the ESignLiveExamples class.

To get started, you'll need to create a free developer account [here](http://bit.ly/1NWBoEo).

Documentation for the SDK can be accessed [here](http://bit.ly/1TtTXwb).

For help, use eSignLive's [Developer Community](http://bit.ly/1TtTZEf).

       src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/afawcett/githubsfdeploy/master/src/main/webapp/resources/img/deploy.png">
</a> button.

Alternatively, it can be installed as an unmanaged package:
* [Production/Developer Sandbox](http://bit.ly/1Nk4s91)
* [Test Sandbox](http://bit.ly/1NWRWfm)

After installing in your sandbox or developer org you'll need to configure the connection settings by creating an entry in the eSignLive Connection Settings custom setting. You need to know if you are using eSignLive Classic or eSingLive New in order to set accordingly the Endpoint field in eSignLive Connection Settings custom setting.  

**Name** = Main  
**Endpoint** = https://sandbox.e-signlive.com/api (CLASSIC SANDBOX) || https://apps.e-signlive.com/api (CLASSIC PROD) ||  https://sandbox.esignlive.com/api (NEW SANDBOX) || https://apps.esignlive.com/api (NEW PROD)  
**API Key** = YOUR_API_KEY - can be obtained by going to the Account page in your eSignLive Sandbox.  For production accounts it should be emailed to you upon account creation.
